Melissa, Michael and Ted were all playing darts. Melissa was winning the whole time, but then...a monster approached! It was none other than Katrina Van Tassel, but this time, she was missing her head!!! (still a huge feminist icon though).

At that point, Melissa threw three bulls-eyes in a row to win the game, but just as she was about to celebrate, Katrina ATTACKED!

The lights in the room flickered quickly. Katrina slowly drew closer to the friends as they cowered in the corner. "Down with the patriarchy", she groaned, as the lightbulbs in the chandelier suddenly exploded in a puff of hot white, electric smoke.

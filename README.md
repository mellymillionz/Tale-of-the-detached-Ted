# Tale of the Detached HEAD
### A spooky exercise in version control

### Character List:

**Melissa** - The main protagonist of the story and obvious hero.
**Michael** - A guy who thinks hes going to be the one to win at darts, but whose character arc throughout the story will show him heroically winning a sword in an archery contest after a guy in rennaissance clothes with a fake irish accent makes fun of him.
**Ted** - A Sleep-Hollow native who is likely to be best equipped to defeat Katrina Van Tassel...but only after a fifth of Irish Whiskey at Giant Ledge. Will he remember the end of the story?? Only time will tell!

Melissa, Michael and Ted were all playing darts. Melissa was winning the whole time, but then...a monster approached! It was none other than Katrina Van Tassel, but this time, she was missing her head!!! (still a huge feminist icon though).

At that point, Melissa threw three bullseyes in a row to win the game, but just as she was about to celebrate, Katrina ATTACKED!

The lights in the room flickered quickly. Katrina slowly drew closer to the friends as they cowered in the corner. "Down with the patriarchy", she groaned, as the lightbulbs in the chandelier suddenly exploded in a puff of hot white, electric smoke.
